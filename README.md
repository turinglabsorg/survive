# 🎮 survive: (The Game Where You Probably Won't)

A retro-style isometric survival game where your only job is to reach the yellow star without dying. Spoiler alert: you'll probably die anyway.

## 🎯 What Is This?

Imagine if Pac-Man had a midlife crisis and decided to become an isometric grid-based nightmare. That's this game.

You're a green circle (yes, just a circle) trying to reach a yellow star while:
- 🟥 Red squares want to murder you
- 🟡 Yellow tiles are actually traps (plot twist!)
- ⚪ White walls are... well, walls
- 🎯 You have limited steps (because life is unfair)

## 🚀 How to Play

### Desktop
- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move your green circle of hope
- **SPACE** to restart when you inevitably fail

### Mobile
- Use the on-screen arrow buttons (because touchscreens are a thing now)
- Try not to throw your phone when you die for the 10th time

## 🎲 Game Rules (Because We Need Rules)

1. **Reach the yellow star** - That's the goal. Simple, right? Wrong.
2. **Avoid red enemies** - They shoot at you. They're not friendly.
3. **Don't step on yellow tiles** - They're traps. Yes, the same color as your goal. We're evil like that.
4. **Don't run out of steps** - You have a limited number of moves. Use them wisely. Or don't. We're not your boss.
5. **Don't get shot** - Enemies shoot orange bullets. They hurt. A lot.
