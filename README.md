# 🎮 survive: (The Game Where You Probably Won't)

A retro-style isometric survival game where your only job is to reach the yellow star without dying. Spoiler alert: you'll probably die anyway.

## 🎯 What Is This?

Imagine if Pac-Man had a midlife crisis and decided to become an isometric grid-based nightmare. That's this game.

You're a green circle (yes, just a circle) trying to reach a yellow star while:
- 🟥 Red squares want to murder you (they shoot orange bullets that actually hurt)
- 🟡 Yellow tiles are actually traps (plot twist! Same color as your goal. We're evil like that.)
- ⚪ White walls are... well, walls. They block your path AND enemy bullets (because even walls have standards and won't let projectiles through. They're the real MVPs of this game.)
- 🎯 You have limited steps (but we multiplied them by 1000x because we're generous... or maybe just sadistic)

## 🚀 How to Play

### Desktop
- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** for 4-directional movement
- **Q, E, Z, C** for diagonal movement (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right)
- **SPACE** to restart when you inevitably fail
- **Joystick** in bottom-right corner (drag with mouse for continuous movement)

### Mobile
- Use the **joystick** at the bottom center (drag to move continuously)
- Hold the joystick in any direction and your circle will keep moving (like a button being held down)
- Try not to throw your phone when you die for the 10th time

## 🎲 Game Rules (Because We Need Rules)

1. **Reach the yellow star** - That's the goal. Simple, right? Wrong.
2. **Avoid red enemies** - They shoot at you. They're not friendly.
3. **Don't step on yellow tiles** - They're traps. Yes, the same color as your goal. We're evil like that.
4. **Don't run out of steps** - You have a limited number of moves (multiplied by 1000x, so you have plenty... or do you?)
5. **Don't get shot** - Enemies shoot orange bullets. They hurt. A lot.
6. **Walls block bullets** - Those white walls aren't just decorative! They actually stop enemy bullets (unlike you, who just gets blocked by them). Walls: 1, You: 0.

## 🛠️ Installation (If You're Into That Sort of Thing)

```bash
# Clone this repository (if you want to suffer locally)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/test-opencode.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd test-opencode

# Install dependencies (there aren't many, we're minimalists)
npm install

# Run it locally (because why not?)
npm start
```

Or just visit the [live version](https://turinglabsorg.github.io/survive/) and play directly. We're not picky.

## 🎨 Features

- ✅ Retro green-on-black aesthetic (because we're hipsters)
- ✅ Isometric grid with dynamic tile sizing (because flat is boring and screens vary)
- ✅ 8-directional movement (4 cardinal + 4 diagonal directions)
- ✅ Joystick controls on mobile AND desktop (drag for continuous movement)
- ✅ Continuous movement when joystick is held (like a button being pressed)
- ✅ Random grid sizes (10-20 tiles, keeps you on your toes)
- ✅ Enemies that actually try to kill you (because challenge)
- ✅ Bullets blocked by walls (walls have standards, unlike your survival skills)
- ✅ Score system (because we need to measure your failure)
- ✅ Game over screens (because you'll see them a lot)

## 🐛 Known "Features"

- Random grid sizes every game (10-20 tiles, because variety is the spice of death)
- Enemies respawn when killed (they're persistent little buggers)
- The grid size adapts to your screen (tiles scale dynamically, because we're considerate)
- Walls block bullets but not you (they're selective about what they stop)
- Continuous joystick movement (hold it and watch your circle go... until it doesn't)
- You might rage quit (we don't judge)

## 🏆 Scoring

- You start with a score based on the distance to the star (multiplied by 1000x for... reasons)
- Each step decreases your score by 1
- If you reach 0, you lose (obviously)
- If you reach the star, you win (surprisingly)
- The grid size is random (10-20 tiles), so each game is different

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Why is this so hard?**  
A: Life is hard. Get used to it.

**Q: Can I cheat?**  
A: Technically yes, but where's the fun in that?

**Q: Why green and black?**  
A: Because we're nostalgic for 1980s terminals.

**Q: Why do walls block bullets but I can't walk through them?**  
A: Walls are picky. They'll stop enemy bullets (because walls have standards) but they'll also stop you (because walls are jerks). It's a double standard, literally.

**Q: Why is the joystick on desktop too?**  
A: Because sometimes you want to feel like you're playing on a console while sitting at your computer. We support your delusions.

**Q: Will you add more levels?**  
A: Maybe. If we feel like it. No promises. The random grid sizes keep things interesting anyway.

**Q: Is there a story?**  
A: You're a circle trying to reach a star while walls block bullets but not you (because life is unfair). That's the story. We're minimalists.

## 🎯 Tips for Survival

1. **Plan your route** - Random movement = certain death
2. **Watch enemy patterns** - They're predictable, but still dangerous
3. **Use walls as cover** - Walls block bullets! Hide behind them like the coward you are (we won't judge)
4. **Use diagonal movement** - Sometimes the shortest path isn't straight (Q, E, Z, C keys)
5. **Hold the joystick** - Continuous movement is your friend (or enemy, depending on your coordination)
6. **Save your steps** - Don't wander aimlessly (we're looking at you)
7. **Avoid yellow tiles** - Seriously, they're traps
8. **Don't panic** - Panic leads to mistakes. Mistakes lead to death.
